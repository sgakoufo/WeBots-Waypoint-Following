# WeBots-Waypoint-Following

The following project uses a waypoint-following algorithm to explore the entire envionment and generate an accurate map of the environment using sensors. For more information on the approach used for this project, please read my report for this project.

To run this experiment, download and install wWeBots WeBots version ****R2022a**** and open the file test_world.wbt in the “worlds” folder. You can then run the simulation by pressing ctrl+2. The window showing the map covered will appear on the top left and can be adjusted, and the status of the experiment will be constantly updated on the console on the bottom of the screen.
